def project_calories(
    weight, height, sex, age, pal, target_weight, number_of_days, return_graph=False
):
    """Returns caloric intake per day based in a target weight. Assumption is
    that the goal is losing weight rather than gaining weight.

    Parameters
    ----------
    weight : float
        Current weight in kilograms (kg).
    height : float
        Current height in meters (m).
    sex : int
        Sex, used in the Harrisâ€“Benedict equation estimation, 1 for male and
        2 for female.
    age : int
        Current age in years.
    pal : float
        Physcial activity level, can only be one of the four listed values
        1.2 for "Little/no exercise"
        1.4 for "Light exercise 1-3 times a week"
        1.6 for "Moderate exercise 3-5 times a week"
        1.75 for "Hard exercise 3-5 times a week"
    target_weight: int
        Weight goal to be achieved in number_of_days.
    number_of_days : int
        Number of days allotted to achieve target_weight.
    return_graph : bool
        Whether to return a graph instead of a float.

    Returns
    -------
    float or `plotly.graph_objects.Figure`
        If `return_graph` is `False`, returns a float specifying caloric intake
        divided by the number of days.
        If `return_graph` is `True`, returns a straight line graph of projected
        weight loss per day.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> project_calories(100, 1.85, 1, 25, 1.6, 75, 25, return_graph=False)
    >>> 2417.0400000000004
