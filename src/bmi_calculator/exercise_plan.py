def exercise_plan(weight, height, sex, age, target_weight, number_of_days, return_graph=False):
    """Create an exercise plan based on current weight, height, age and target
    BMI.

    The calorie consumption needed each day is computed and a set of activities
    is suggested accordingly. If `return_graph` is `True`, a
    `plotly.graph_objects.Figure` object instead of a dictionary.

    Parameters
    ----------
    weight : float
        Weight, in kilograms.
    height : float
        Height, in meters.
    sex : int
        Sex, used in the Harrisâ€“Benedict equation estimation, 1 for male and
        2 for female.
    age : int
        Current age, in years.
    target_weight : float
        Target weight, in kilograms.
    number_of_days : int
        Number of days to reach the target weight.
    return_graph : bool
        Whether to return a graph instead of a dictionary.
    
    Returns
    -------
    dict or plotly.graph_objects.Figure
        If `return_graph` is `False`, we get a dictionary with key to be different
        exercises, and the value to be number of minutes (rounded to nearest
        integer) needed for that activity. Note that each of the activities are
        associated as an "or". If `return_graph` is True, we get a
        `plotly.graph_objects.Figure` instead that can be saved or shared.
    
    Examples
    --------
    >>> exercise_plan(100, 1.83, 2, 27, 68, 30)
    >>> {'Leisure cycling or walking': 213,
    >>> 'Moderate rope-jumping': 88,
    >>> 'General running': 112,
    >>> 'Leisure swimming': 156}
